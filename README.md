The main purpose of this repo is to demonstrate an implementation of PPO to various Gym environments. It also includes functioning REINFORCE and A2C learners.

WIP implementations of an agent to solve Tetris (environment provided here --> https://github.com/Max-We/Tetris-Gymnasium) and a simple, custom DiceGame class are also available.
