# Basic RL Definitions

Environment - the world in which an agent navigates. Can be physical (a maze or video game) or more abstract.
Agent - the part(s) of the algorithm responsible for learning and navigation in the environment.
State - a description of the agents position in the environment (i.e. position, velocity, bank balance)
Action - a move the agent can make, which may affect the environment.
Trajectory - a sequence of (State, Action, Next State, Reward) which continues either forever, or until a final (terminal) state is reached.
Episode - a single trajectory which ends in the agent reaching a terminal state.
Reward - a one-off number the agent "receives" for fullfilling a user-defined criteria.
Return - the discounted or undiscounted sum of all rewards in an episode.
