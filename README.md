State - a description of the agents position in the environment (i.e. position, velocity, bank balance)< br / >
Action - a move the agent can make, which may affect the environment.< br / >
Trajectory - a sequence of (State, Action, Next State, Reward) which continues either forever, or until a final (terminal) state is reached.< br / >
Episode - a single trajectory which ends in the agent reaching a terminal state.< br / >
Reward - a one-off number the agent "receives" for fullfilling a user-defined criteria.< br / >
